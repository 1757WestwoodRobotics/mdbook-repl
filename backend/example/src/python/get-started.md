## Who should read this tutorial?

This tutorial is for developers who want to learn the Python programming language from scratch. Of course, this tutorial will also provide some in-depth modules to give you a better understanding of Python applications.

## The first Python program

For most programming languages, the first code to get started is "Hello World!", and the following code is to output "Hello World!" in Python:

```python
# Python

print("Hello, World!")
```

A common Python file extension is .py.

You can save the above code in a hello.py file and execute the script file with python commands.

```bash
python hello.py
```
