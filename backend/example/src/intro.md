# Mdbook REPL

This is a [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook) playground which uses **webassembly** to execute code in the browser. So you can run code in the browser without any server.

This is inspired by mdbook rust playground, but it is not limited to rust. Nowdays, webassembly is very powerful, so I learned it and try to make a playground for multiple languages with mdbook.

Now only **Python** is supported, maybe I will add more languages in the future.

```python
# Python

print("Hello, World!")
```

Tell me if you have any ideas or suggestions.
