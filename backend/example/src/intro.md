# Mdbook REPL

This is a [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook) real time playground for some programmes which you can directly execute them in the browser without any server. It's fast and easy to use.

This is mostly inspired by [mdbook rust playground](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mdbook.html#rust-playground), but it's only limited to rust and it's using [https://play.rust-lang.org](https://play.rust-lang.org) as its backend compiler server. So I want to make a playground for multiple languages with mdbook which do not need any backend server to execute the code.

Below is an example of a python code block that can be executed directly in the browser:

```python
# Python codeblock

print("Hello, world!")
```

All the code is **editable** and **runnable**. You can change the code and run it again. The execution is really fast.

> This playground is still in development and not many languages are supported yet. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know.
