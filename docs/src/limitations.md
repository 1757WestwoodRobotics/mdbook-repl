# Limitations

There are some limitations when using this playground, because of the nature of the technologies used in this playground. So, don't expect to use this playground as a full-featured IDE.

The best usage of this playground is to test and learn programming languages for educational purposes, not for production.

If you find any other issues, don't hesitate to report it to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MR-Addict/mdbook-repl).

**User input**

For example, you can not use the **input** function to get user input in python. Though it is possible to play arround to make user input work, but it's not worth it. The following code won't work:

```python
# This will not work

input('Enter your name: ')
```

**Interrupt**

And now there is also no easy way for **interrupt** your code, so don't write bad code!!
