# Limitations

There are some limitations when using this playground. If you find any, don't hesitate to report it to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MR-Addict/mdbook-repl).

But there are some limitations that are not possible to fix, because of the nature of the technologies used in this playground. So, don't expect to use this playground as a full-featured IDE.

The best usage of this playground is to test and learn typescript for educational purposes, not for production.

For example, you can not use the **input** function to get user input in python. Though it is possible to play arround to make user input work, but it's not worth it.

The following code won't work:

```python
# This will not work

input('Enter your name: ')
```

And now there is also no easy way for **interrupt** your code, so dont't write bad code!!
