# Mdbook REPL

This is a [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook) playground which uses **webassembly** to execute code in the browser. So you can run code in the browser without any server.

This is inspired by [mdbook rust playground](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mdbook.html#rust-playground), but it is not limited to rust. Recent years, webassembly is very powerful and able to so many things. So I want to learned it and try to make a playground for multiple languages for mdbook.

```python
# Python codeblock

print("Hello, world!")
```

All the code is **editable** and **runnable**. You can change the code and run it again. The output will be updated immediately.

> ðŸ’¥ Attention
>
> This project only supports python for now. More languages will be supported in the future.

Tell me if you have any ideas or suggestions.
