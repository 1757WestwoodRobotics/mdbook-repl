# Mdbook REPL

This is a [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook) real time programmes playground which you can directly execute code in the browser without any server. So its very fast and easy to use.

This is inspired by [mdbook rust playground](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mdbook.html#rust-playground), but it is limited to rust. I try to make a playground for multiple languages for mdbook.

Below is an example of a python code block that can be executed in the browser:

```python
# Python codeblock

print("Hello, world!")
```

All the code is **editable** and **runnable**. You can change the code and run it again. The output will be updated immediately.

> Attention ðŸ’¥

> This playground is still in development and not many languages are supported yet. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know.
